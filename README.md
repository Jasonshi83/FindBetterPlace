Project Name: Website FindBetterPlace

Project Description and objective: 

This is a website that allows people to share their bad experience in rental housing in the city.  

The website can show all the cases saved in the database, and show them on the google map.  When the user clicks the marker on the map, more detail information will pop-up.

People who want to rent a house in the city can search on the website to see if there were some bad comments about the house.
By knowing the stories shared by other lessees, people will have another way to get comprehensive information about the house which they are going to rent.

Instead of the information provided by the house lord/ agency, By knowing the stories shared by other lessees, people will have another way to get comprehensive information about the house which they are going to rent.  

I believe this is a great way to help people get away from the bad house lord.
